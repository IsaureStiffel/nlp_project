## The dataset

I used a dataset on summary of books to classify them by genre :

## Where I am

I explored the dataset. 
I preprocessed the data first by a python file with simple preprocessing, then I explored the datas to find more way to simplify my datas. 
In the final processing file I added the suppression of most common words and of words appearing only one time. 

I then created simple models with BoW and TF-IDF methods and some model of machine learning. 

I am now trying to get better performance of my model.
